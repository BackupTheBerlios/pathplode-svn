This is release 0.6 of pathplode. Please note that pathplode is alpha software
and might change. Even though the tool is very small it is very likely there are
still some bugs lurking!

Feedback to the author is welcome!

******************** DESCRIPTION

Pathplode is a small utility to efficiently modify the PATH environment variable
(or similar variables). 

It is especially meant for use in company environments, in which the PATH is
modified by diverse authorities (system administrator, tool administrators and
user). Very often tools can be selected by a tool which modifies the PATH
variable, usually adding more path elements. This will lead to a long PATH with
several elements contained more than once.

To get the documentation: Just type 'pathplode --help'!

A typical usage to clean up the path might look like:

PATH=`pathplode --uniquify $PATH`

If you want to know which path elements are present more than once:

pathplode --list --colour $PATH

This will show all elements of the PATH with shadowed elements in red:

/home/ulf/gnu/bin
/home/ulf/bin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/bin/X11
/usr/games
/home/ulf/gnu/bin      <= This will be red (and would be removed by uniquify)


You can also modify the PATH:

PATH=`pathplode --unique --append ~/gnu/bin $PATH`


******************** CHANGES

0.3:

First Release

0.5:

Allow multiple commands in one pathplode call. This includes the following changes:
 - The --unique option is obsolete.
 - Order matters! Options must now be given before the command. They stay in effect
   until removed by the --reset-options (-r) option.

0.6:
 - fixed a bug: assignment operator removed
 - regular expressions are supported now with the -R option
