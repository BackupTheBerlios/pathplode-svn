Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*-

* Enhancements & Open Concept Questions 
** allow several commands to be passed at once to prevent multiple pathplode calls
   Is it tolerable to have this solved by calling pathplode several times?
   At least this strongly points to use only the C++ version, as this should have
   a much shorter load time.  
** concept for error handling
   OK, for now this is done with return  values. 
** Currently hooks are regexps in perl version and fixed strings in C++ version.
   Maybe using fixed strings is sufficient for the targeted applications.
   Actually the perl version is quite unsupported now...
** color codes for terminals....
   what is the right way of specifying them instead of hardcoding them? 
** concept confusion: --unique too thorough
   If an append or prepend is done with unique and the inserted element is behind
   an existing one, the new one will be removed again by the --unique.
   While this is correct according to the specification, it will none of less confuse
   the user and lead to unexpected results.
