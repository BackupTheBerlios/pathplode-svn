Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*-

* Enhancements & Open Concept Questions 
** allow several commands to be passed at once to prevent multiple pathplode calls
   Is it tolerable to have this solved by calling pathplode several times?
   At least this strongly points to use only the C++ version, as this should have
   a much shorter load time.  
** concept for error handling
** Currently hooks are regexps in perl version and fixed strings in C++ version.
   Maybe using fixed strings is sufficient for the targeted applications.
** color codes for terminals....
   what is the right way of specifying them instead of hardcoding them?
