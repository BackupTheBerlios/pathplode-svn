Hey Emacs, this is -*- outline -*-

* Just now...

** nothing :-)

* Enhancements & Open Concept Questions 
** concept for error handling
   OK, for now this is done with return values. 
** color codes for terminals....
   what is the right way of specifying them instead of hardcoding them? 



* Closed

** allow several commands to be passed at once to prevent multiple pathplode calls
   Is it tolerable to have this solved by calling pathplode several times?
   At least this strongly points to use only the C++ version, as this should have
   a much shorter load time.  
** Currently hooks are regexps in perl version and fixed strings in C++ version.
   Actually the perl version is quite unsupported now...
   But the C++ version should support regexps. This would ease switching tool versions,
   e.g. replacing /opt/tool-3.5/bin with /opt/tool-3.7/bin without knowing which version
   of the tool is selected. DONE - regexps in c++ supported now!


** Fix slash removal - OK, it's a global option now
** Fix choosing separator - OK, it's a global option now
** Fix empty entries - OK, it's a global option now
** unique option is deprecated? => unique does a uniquify at the beginning and at the end
